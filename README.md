# Hacking-prevention-bug-project
This project focuses on securing systems from cyber threats through secure coding, code reviews, and penetration testing. It prevents SQLi via parameterized queries, XSS by input sanitization, and DoS/DDoS with rate limiting. Data is encrypted at rest and in transit, with JWT-based role access, logging, and continuous monitoring for reliability.
